**NPyFind** is a tool for search files under a certain directory, released
under **GPLv3**.

- You can search files with names case sensitive or insensitive, search
recursive in the directory or not, and do filters by certain suffix.
- NPyFind will remember your options and search directories/keywords to
make your next time search a little easier.
- After the files are showed in the result table, you can open it, or copy
or move it to somewhere else, or delete it.

All wrote in *Python/WxPython*, This tool in fact is the successor of
**[PyFind](https://github.com/chunis/pyfind)**,
but precursor of
**[SPyFind](https://github.com/chunis/spyfind)**
and
**[BookMate](https://github.com/chunis/bookmate)**.

**Note:**
*This project is far from complete, and very likely won't be continued.*
All functions should be found in **bookmate**. This code exists just for
keeping its development history, and as an (ugly) reference code base.
